      <p>
        I'm Mamatha, a passionate Frontend Developer with 3+ years of experience
        crafting responsive and user-friendly web applications. I specialize in
        React.js, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like Next.js and Tailwind
        CSS. My focus is on building clean, scalable UI components and
        integrating seamless API-driven features. I enjoy learning new
        technologies, solving real-world problems through code, and continuously
        improving my skills to deliver high-quality digital experiences. Beyond
        coding, I believe in collaboration, growth, and sharing knowledge to
        inspire others to achieve their goals while creating intuitive
        interfaces that make an impact.
